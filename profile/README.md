# Statistical Modeling and Inference for Data Science (DATA 730)

This course will be coding oriented and cover the concepts underpinning and the applications of
statistical modeling/inference. We will build models with real-world data and modern data science
toolkits in Python and R like scikit-learn and tidymodels. Concepts covered in this course will include:
- Foundations in probability, including basic rules, Bayesâ€™ formula, basic distributions
- Sampling and the central limit theorem
- Bootstrapping, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, multiple testing
- Linear models, basic and multiple regression, inference for regression, regularization
- Classification, logistic regression and tree-based methods
- Prediction, model interpretation, model evaluation
